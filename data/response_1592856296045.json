All samples were transported via cooler to the lab where they were frozen until analysis. Samples were measured by ion chromatography on a Metrohm Compact IC. Standard curves were calibrated using independent NIST-traceable standards, and standards were run as unknowns to check analytical precision. GPS coordinates for each discharge site were recorded using a Garmin® GPSMAP 64. The purpose for these measurements is to determine areas of significant groundwater-surface water interaction.",

      "abstract": "This dataset contains a stage-discharge relationship developed for the aquatic site at Blacksmith Fork above confluence with Logan River (LR_BSF_BA). Discharge measurements were collected by a SonTek FlowTracker. Measured stage and discharge and the curve are contained in the Rating Curve file. Information on the site conditions and any issues with discharge measurements are documented in the README file. Files associated with each measurement (e.g., output by the FlowTracker instrument) are contained in the .zip directory. This rating curve was used to generate discharge data through 6/30/2018. New versions of these files may be loaded when new flow measurements are taken. Resulting discharge data is published in the Logan River Observatory operational databases and may be accessed via http://lrodata.usu.edu/tsa/ or https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/67dc333cb7a9451fab1e926f7bd332bd/.",

The Kosñipata River at the San Pedro gauging station drains an area of 164.4 km2. Field measurements consisted of river height, flow velocity, and cross-sectional area, which together allowed us to estimate discharge and runoff over the study period. River stage height was measured from January 2010 to February 2011 using a river logger (GlobalWater WL16 Data Logger, range 0–9 m), recording river level every 15 min. The instantaneous discharge associated with each height measurement was calculated based on calibrated stage–discharge relationships. The Kosñipata River discharge at San Pedro was measured through a complete water year,  with a 31-day gap partly in July and August (during low flow) that was covered by three manual measurements and the gap was filled using linear interpolation.\r\n\r\nSheet 2: Weekly to monthly discharge measurements at the Wayqecha gauging station (2250 m.a.s.l), along the Kosñipata River, in the Andes of Peru. The Wayqecha sub-catchment a nested catchment upstream of the San Pedro gauging station. It  encompasses the headwaters of the Kosñipata River, draining an area of 48.5 km2 (See the supplementary information in Clark et al. 2014). Locations of the San Pedro and Wayqecha gauging stations are provided as GIS coverages in a companion dataset. \r\n\r\nThis product was created by Kathryn Clark (kathryn.clark23@gmail.com). \r\n\r\nOther related datasets from Clark et al.

Discharge was measured using a Marsh McBurney hand-held flowmeter. DO, TDS, and stream temperature were measured using a YSI Pro 2030 water quality probe. Pebble count was conducted using a modified Wolman procedure where a random pebble is picked up every step diagonally across a stream in a zig-zag pattern until at least 100 pebbles are measured. The pebble is then measured to obtain size and recorded.  Geomorphic condition was assessed visually by taking note of conditions such as stream complexity (presence or lack of pools, riffles, meandering thalweg etc.), percent shade on stream, flow and depth variability, bank stability, access to floodplain, wood recruitment, unnatural barriers and condition and quantity of riparian vegetation. Based on the these conditions, a classification of excellent, good, moderate, or poor was assigned. Atmospheric pressure, wind speed and air temperature were measured with a Kestrel handheld weather meter, cloud cover was assessed visually. A site key in addition to the date, time and location (latitude/longitude and UTM) is included.  Not all sites have values for discharge and pebble count due to hazardous conditions. ",

This watershed was delineated in ArcGIS using the USGS discharge gage 01665500 as the pour point. Runoff was modeled using the SCS curve number method. CN was estimated using land use data in ArcGIS. Transform method used was the SCS unit hydrograph. The basin was subdivided into three subbasins which were routed using the Muskingum routing method. Parameters for the Mukingum method were determined using ArcGIS. The model was calibrated to a storm occurring on 29 December 2013 and verified using a second storm occurring on 25 January 2003. The Nash-Sutcliffe goodness of fit value for the verification storm was determined to be 0.825.",

      "abstract": "HEC-HMS 4.2.1 can be used to accurately route stream flow through a selected watershed. A model of the Rapidan River Watershed, VA was calibrated using a precipitation event occurring on April 2nd, 2005 at 15:00PM. The baseflow method chosen was the recession method and Muskingum routing was used as a routing method. Optimization trials were used once the model closely resembled the observed precipitation event. Model accuracy was determined by the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient and Peak Volume of discharge, before testing the model with additional precipitation events of similar size and seasonal occurrence. Peak discharge volume was unable to match the observed data for additional storms. The model was able to predict the time of peak discharge with accuracy, all three storm peaks reported within 15 minutes of observed data. Since this model was able to accurately predict the time of the peak discharge, it is still possible to use this model for temporal flow routing through the Rapidan River Watershed. It would  not be accurate to use this model to quantify the amount of discharge occurring during a precipitation event.",

The main focus is to observe the changes in discharge trends before and after Short Pump Town Center was built in 2003. The Soil Conservation Service also uses a Curve Number method that takes into account land use/cover, hydrological soil groups, and geography of the watershed. These parameters are then used in The Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) designed by the US Army Corps of Engineers to model frequency storms.

      "abstract": "The delineation of groundwater discharge areas based on Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) data of the streambed can be difficult in soft‐bedded streams where sedimentation and scouring processes constantly change the position of the fibre optic cable relative to the streambed. Deposition‐induced temperature anomalies resemble the signal of groundwater discharge while scouring will cause the cable to float in the water column and measure stream water temperatures. DTS applied in a looped layout with nine fibre optic cable rows in a 70 × 5 m section of a soft‐bedded stream made it possible to detect variability in streambed temperatures between October 2011 and January 2012. Detailed monthly streambed elevation surveys were carried out to monitor the position of the fibre optic cable relative to the streambed and to quantify the effect of sedimentation processes on streambed temperatures. Based on the simultaneous interpretation of streambed temperature and elevation data, a method is proposed to delineate potential high‐groundwater discharge areas and identify deposition‐induced temperature anomalies in soft‐bedded streams. Potential high‐discharge sites were detected using as metrics the daily minimum, maximum and mean streambed temperatures as well as the daily amplitude and standard deviation of temperatures. The identified potential high‐discharge areas were mostly located near the channel banks, also showing temporal variability because of the scouring and redistribution of streambed sediments, leading to the relocation of pool‐riffle sequences. This study also shows that sediment deposits of 0.1 m thickness already resulted in an increase in daily minimum streambed temperatures and decrease in daily amplitude and standard deviation. Scouring sites showed lower daily minimum streambed temperatures and higher daily amplitude and standard deviation compared with areas without sedimentation and scouring. As a limitation of the approach, groundwater discharge occurring at depositional and scouring areas cannot be identified by the metrics applied. \r\n\r\nRaw project data is available by contacting ctemps@unr.edu",

      "abstract": "Hydrologic extremes, such as drought, offer an exceptional opportunity to explore how runoff generation mechanisms and stream networks respond to changing precipitation regimes. The winter of 2014-2015 was the warmest on record in western Oregon, US, with record low snowpacks, and was followed by an anomalously warm, dry spring, resulting in historically low streamflows. But a year like 2015 is more than an outlier meteorological year. It provides a unique opportunity to test fundamental hypotheses for how montane hydrologic systems will respond to anticipated changes in amount and timing of recharge. In particular, the volcanic Cascade Mountains represent a “landscape laboratory” comprised of two distinct runoff regimes: the surface-flow dominated Western Cascade watersheds, with flashy streamflow regimes, rapid baseflow recession, and very low summer flows; and (b) the spring-fed High Cascade watersheds, with a slow-responding streamflow regime, and a long and sustained baseflow recession that maintains late summer streamflow through deep-groundwater contributions to high volume, coldwater springs.\r\nWe hypothesize that stream network response to the extremely low snowpack and subsequent recharge varies sharply in these two regions. In surface flow dominated streams, the location of channel heads can migrate downstream, contracting the network longitudinally; the wetted channel width and depth contract laterally as summer recession proceeds and flows diminish. In contrast, in spring-fed streams, channel heads “jump” to the next downstream spring when upper basin spring flow diminishes to zero. Downstream of flowing springs, wetted channel width and depth contract laterally as flows recede. \r\nTo test these hypotheses, we conducted a field campaign to measure changing discharge, hydraulic geometry, and channel head location in both types of watersheds throughout the summer and early fall. Multiple cross-section sites were established on 6 streams representing both flow regime types on either side of the Cascade crest. In addition we took Isotopic water samples to determine recharge elevations of receding streams. Taken together these measurements reveal the processes by which drainage networks contract as flows diminish – a fundamental property of montane stream systems both now and in the future. ",

This site monitors water quantity and quality for water released from Glen Canyon Dam that then flows through the Grand Canyon. To call these services in Python, the suds-py3 package was used. Using this package, a “GetValuesObject” request, as defined by WaterOneFlow, was passed to the server using inputs for the web service url, site code, variable code, and dates of interest. For this case, 15-minute discharge from August 1, 2018 to the current date was used. The web service returned an object from which the dates and the data values were obtained, as well as the site name. The Python libraries Pandas and Matplotlib were used to manipulate and view the results. The time series data were converted to lists and then to a Pandas series object. Using the “resample” function of Pandas, values for mean, minimum, and maximum were determined on a daily basis from the 15-minute data. Using Matplotlib, a figure object was created to which Pandas series objects were added using the Pandas plot method. The daily mean, minimum, maximum, and the 15-minute flow values were added to illustrate the differences in the daily ranges of data. ",

      "abstract": "Biogeochemical reactions within intertidal zones of coastal aquifers, induced by the mixing between fresh groundwater and saline seawater, have been shown to alter the concentrations of terrestrial solutes prior to their coastal discharge. In organic-poor sandy aquifers, the input of marine organic matter from infiltrating seawater has been attributed to active biogeochemical reactions within the sediments. However, while the seasonality of surface water organic carbon concentrations (primary production) and groundwater mixing patterns have been well-documented, there has been limited speculation on the contributions of particulate organic carbon pools within the sediments that arise from transient hydrologic conditions. To understand the relationship between physical movements of the circulation cell and the seasonal migration of geochemical patterns, beach porewater and sediment samples from six field sampling events spanning two years were analyzed. While oxygen saturation, oxygen consumption rates, and silica distributions closely followed the seasonally-dynamic salinity, other chemically-reactive parameters (pH, ORP) and nutrient characteristics (N distributions, denitrification rates, reactive organic carbon distributions) were unrelated to contemporaneous salinity patterns. Particulate organic matter was distributed in pools within the aquifer due to the filtration effect of sediments, contributing to the divergence of chemical patterns from salinity patterns via nutrient release and leaching. Together, the results present the asynchronous movement of chemical conditions to salinity patterns due to the divergent transport pathways between solutes and particles arising from transient hydrologic forcing.",

      "abstract": "The main objective of the research 'The source of the southern tributary of the Ruebisbaach' is to figure out and understand what sources makes the southern tributary still flowing in a dry period and why it does so compared with the northern tributary. The geographical focus of the research report is the southern catchment of the Ruebisbaach. In the results of the research the southern catchment will be compared with the northern catchment. The results includes measured data during the research proces. These data is originated from various discharge and infiltration methods. All the collected discharge and infiltration data were processed in excel formats and analyzed in a systematic way. To find the right data the excel name is described as ‘Method_Topic_Catchment_Year’. For example if you want to find all Levelstick data it is descripted as ‘Levestick_Discharge_Ruebisbaach_2019’.",

They are critical to water availability for domestic, agricultural, and industrial use. They are the source of floods, which are among the Nation's most severe natural disasters, both in loss of life and in economic damage. They provide the habitat, spawning grounds, and avenues of movement for fish. Streams are a source of great recreational activity in terms of boating, fishing, and simple enjoyment of visiting and viewing the stream and its environs. Finally, streams are indicators of the condition of the landscape. They integrate effects from their entire watershed. \n\n\n\nSurface-water information collected at these streamflow-measurement stations is used for surveillance, planning, design, flood warning, operation and management of dams, in water-related fields such as water supply, flood control, irrigation, bridge and culvert design, wildlife management, pollution abatement, flood-plain management, and water-resources development.\nDate Range Comments: 15 minute intervals",

      "abstract": "Since 1969, the U.S. Geological Survey and the Chester County Water Resources Authority have conducted a cooperative program to evaluate stream ecology and water-quality conditions using benthic macroinvertebrates and stream-water chemistry. The Stream Conditions of Chester County Program has sampled streams every fall for over 30 years. The initial goals of the program were to evaluate stream-water quality and to further the understanding of changes in the stream ecosystem in response to urbanization. The current goals of the program are to use the data to monitor current conditions and determine trends. Data from the program have been used to help support Chester County Landscapes by providing information on biological diversity and water-quality conditions. Without monitoring it is impossible to determine if changes in land use or environmental policies and regulation are having a positive affect on water quality.\n\n\n\nBenthic macroinvertebrates are macroscopic animals that inhabit the bottoms of aquatic habitats. Freshwater forms include aquatic insects and other invertebrates including clams, crustaceans, snails, and worms. Factors such as streamflow, food availability, habitat, temperature, and water quality determine the makeup of the macroinvertebrate community. By sampling in similar habitats with similar physical conditions, water quality becomes the determining factor controlling community structure. Changes in abundance, diversity, species richness, and presence or absence of pollution tolerant or intolerant species can be measured and related to water quality. Trends in water quality can be determined by sampling at a single location over several years and observing changes to the community structure. \n\n\n\nBenthic macroinvertebrates are well suited as water-quality indicators because of their biology and availability. They are present in most aquatic systems and are relatively easy to collect. They are indicators of overall water quality and can be used to identify specific types and sources of degraded water quality. Benthic macroinvertebrates have limited mobility and cannot avoid poor water-quality conditions. They are sensitive to a wide range of environmental impacts including chemical and physical impairments. \n\n\n\nBiological samples collected for the Stream Conditions of Chester County Biological Monitoring Network consist of benthic macroinvertebrates collected from a riffle area of the stream. A riffle habitat is used because macroinvertebrate diversity and abundance is usually highest there. \n\n\n\nSee more info in Comments/README\n\n\n\n",

In comparison to other tropical forests, the LEF as a whole has more evapotranspiration than many tropical montane forests but less evapotranspiration than many lowland tropical forests.\r\n\r\nData a product of USDA Forest Service -IITF:\r\n\r\nGrizelle González - Project Leader, Research Unit\r\nUSDA FS - International Institute of Tropical Forestry\r\nggonzalez@fs.fed.us",
