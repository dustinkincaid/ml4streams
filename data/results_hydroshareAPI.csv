Basin attributes include: a site ID (""site""); the basin area in square km (""area""); the fraction of the basin area impacted by (draining to) a large (>30MW) reservoir (""resvr""); and a numeric indicator for basins located within the same basin network, i.e. nested basins (""group""). None of these basins have reservoir facilities located at their outlets as of 2013, although they may have reservoirs upstream - as indicated by the basin ""resvr"" attribute. Basin and reservoir drainage area boundaries were derived from free, publicly-available geographic information systems (GIS) data obtained from the Brazilian water management and electricity regulatory agencies: Agência Nacional de Águas (ANA) and Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica (ANEEL), respectively.

For each unique basin, there exists a corresponding flow gauge location record (see ""Flow gauge locations for the Brazilian rainforest-savanna transition zone"") and a flow time series record for discharge at the basin outlet (see ""Flow gauge data for the Brazilian rainforest-savanna transition zone""); these are identified by the same site ID numbers.

G., New, M., Horwath, A. B., Fisher, J. B., Rapp, J. M., Robles Caceres, A., and Malhi, Y. (2014), The hydrological regime of a forested tropical Andean catchment, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 18, 5377-5397, doi: 10.5194/hess-18-5377-2014.

Sheet 1: Discharge measurements at the San Pedro gauging station (1360 m.a.s.l.), along the Kosñipata River, in the Andes of Peru. The Kosñipata River at the San Pedro gauging station drains an area of 164.4 km2. Field measurements consisted of river height, flow velocity, and cross-sectional area, which together allowed us to estimate discharge and runoff over the study period. River stage height was measured from January 2010 to February 2011 using a river logger (GlobalWater WL16 Data Logger, range 0–9 m), recording river level every 15 min. The instantaneous discharge associated with each height measurement was calculated based on calibrated stage–discharge relationships. The Kosñipata River discharge at San Pedro was measured through a complete water year,  with a 31-day gap partly in July and August (during low flow) that was covered by three manual measurements and the gap was filled using linear interpolation.

Sheet 2: Weekly to monthly discharge measurements at the Wayqecha gauging station (2250 m.a.s.l), along the Kosñipata River, in the Andes of Peru. The Wayqecha sub-catchment a nested catchment upstream of the San Pedro gauging station. It  encompasses the headwaters of the Kosñipata River, draining an area of 48.5 km2 (See the supplementary information in Clark et al. 2014). Locations of the San Pedro and Wayqecha gauging stations are provided as GIS coverages in a companion dataset.

Discharge was measured using a Marsh McBurney hand-held flowmeter. DO, TDS, and stream temperature were measured using a YSI Pro 2030 water quality probe. Pebble count was conducted using a modified Wolman procedure where a random pebble is picked up every step diagonally across a stream in a zig-zag pattern until at least 100 pebbles are measured. The pebble is then measured to obtain size and recorded.  Geomorphic condition was assessed visually by taking note of conditions such as stream complexity (presence or lack of pools, riffles, meandering thalweg etc.), percent shade on stream, flow and depth variability, bank stability, access to floodplain, wood recruitment, unnatural barriers and condition and quantity of riparian vegetation. Based on the these conditions, a classification of excellent, good, moderate, or poor was assigned. Atmospheric pressure, wind speed and air temperature were measured with a Kestrel handheld weather meter, cloud cover was assessed visually. A site key in addition to the date, time and location (latitude/longitude and UTM) is included.  Not all sites have values for discharge and pebble count due to hazardous conditions. "

ModelInstanceResource,HEC-HMS model for the Rivanna River Watershed,952e062d1a2e498cbbdf2ae1ef5c2eae,This is and HEC-HMS model for direct runoff in a watershed in the Rivanna River basin created for a graduate course in Hydrology at the University of Virginia.  This watershed was delineated in ArcGIS using the USGS discharge gage 01665500 as the pour point. Runoff was modeled using the SCS curve number method. CN was estimated using land use data in ArcGIS. Transform method used was the SCS unit hydrograph. The basin was subdivided into three subbasins which were routed using the Muskingum routing method. Parameters for the Mukingum method were determined using ArcGIS. The model was calibrated to a storm occurring on 29 December 2013 and verified using a second storm occurring on 25 January 2003. The Nash-Sutcliffe goodness of fit value for the verification storm was determined to be 0.825.

A model of the Rapidan River Watershed, VA was calibrated using a precipitation event occurring on April 2nd, 2005 at 15:00PM. The baseflow method chosen was the recession method and Muskingum routing was used as a routing method. Optimization trials were used once the model closely resembled the observed precipitation event. Model accuracy was determined by the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient and Peak Volume of discharge, before testing the model with additional precipitation events of similar size and seasonal occurrence. Peak discharge volume was unable to match the observed data for additional storms. The model was able to predict the time of peak discharge with accuracy, all three storm peaks reported within 15 minutes of observed data. Since this model was able to accurately predict the time of the peak discharge, it is still possible to use this model for temporal flow routing through the Rapidan River Watershed. It would  not be accurate to use this model to quantify the amount of discharge occurring during a precipitation event."

CompositeResource,Application of Distributed Temperature Sensing for coupled mapping of sedimentation processes and spatio‐temporal variability of groundwater discharge in soft‐bedded streams,b0c8a3f3c8384f289eef4fda0086e6b6,"The delineation of groundwater discharge areas based on Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) data of the streambed can be difficult in soft‐bedded streams where sedimentation and scouring processes constantly change the position of the fibre optic cable relative to the streambed. Deposition‐induced temperature anomalies resemble the signal of groundwater discharge while scouring will cause the cable to float in the water column and measure stream water temperatures. DTS applied in a looped layout with nine fibre optic cable rows in a 70 × 5 m section of a soft‐bedded stream made it possible to detect variability in streambed temperatures between October 2011 and January 2012. Detailed monthly streambed elevation surveys were carried out to monitor the position of the fibre optic cable relative to the streambed and to quantify the effect of sedimentation processes on streambed temperatures. Based on the simultaneous interpretation of streambed temperature and elevation data, a method is proposed to delineate potential high‐groundwater discharge areas and identify deposition‐induced temperature anomalies in soft‐bedded streams. Potential high‐discharge sites were detected using as metrics the daily minimum, maximum and mean streambed temperatures as well as the daily amplitude and standard deviation of temperatures. The identified potential high‐discharge areas were mostly located near the channel banks, also showing temporal variability because of the scouring and redistribution of streambed sediments, leading to the relocation of pool‐riffle sequences. This study also shows that sediment deposits of 0.1 m thickness already resulted in an increase in daily minimum streambed temperatures and decrease in daily amplitude and standard deviation. Scouring sites showed lower daily minimum streambed temperatures and higher daily amplitude and standard deviation compared with areas without sedimentation and scouring. As a limitation of the approach, groundwater discharge occurring at depositional and scouring areas cannot be identified by the metrics applied.

CompositeResource,No Snow_No Flow; The 2015 Snow Drought in the Oregon Cascades; Raw and Modeled Hydrologic and Geomorphic Data,51bbc4e748b04656b0d61ee4187eb5bc,"Hydrologic extremes, such as drought, offer an exceptional opportunity to explore how runoff generation mechanisms and stream networks respond to changing precipitation regimes. The winter of 2014-2015 was the warmest on record in western Oregon, US, with record low snowpacks, and was followed by an anomalously warm, dry spring, resulting in historically low streamflows. But a year like 2015 is more than an outlier meteorological year. It provides a unique opportunity to test fundamental hypotheses for how montane hydrologic systems will respond to anticipated changes in amount and timing of recharge. In particular, the volcanic Cascade Mountains represent a “landscape laboratory” comprised of two distinct runoff regimes: the surface-flow dominated Western Cascade watersheds, with flashy streamflow regimes, rapid baseflow recession, and very low summer flows; and (b) the spring-fed High Cascade watersheds, with a slow-responding streamflow regime, and a long and sustained baseflow recession that maintains late summer streamflow through deep-groundwater contributions to high volume, coldwater springs.
We hypothesize that stream network response to the extremely low snowpack and subsequent recharge varies sharply in these two regions. In surface flow dominated streams, the location of channel heads can migrate downstream, contracting the network longitudinally; the wetted channel width and depth contract laterally as summer recession proceeds and flows diminish. In contrast, in spring-fed streams, channel heads “jump” to the next downstream spring when upper basin spring flow diminishes to zero. Downstream of flowing springs, wetted channel width and depth contract laterally as flows recede. 
To test these hypotheses, we conducted a field campaign to measure changing discharge, hydraulic geometry, and channel head location in both types of watersheds throughout the summer and early fall. Multiple cross-section sites were established on 6 streams representing both flow regime types on either side of the Cascade crest. In addition we took Isotopic water samples to determine recharge elevations of receding streams. Taken together these measurements reveal the processes by which drainage networks contract as flows diminish – a fundamental property of montane stream systems both now and in the future. "

CompositeResource,Cape Shores Porewater Data Compilation 2014-2015,440e89b8cc8c4c43bdbc6176e8f38a70,"Biogeochemical reactions within intertidal zones of coastal aquifers, induced by the mixing between fresh groundwater and saline seawater, have been shown to alter the concentrations of terrestrial solutes prior to their coastal discharge. In organic-poor sandy aquifers, the input of marine organic matter from infiltrating seawater has been attributed to active biogeochemical reactions within the sediments. However, while the seasonality of surface water organic carbon concentrations (primary production) and groundwater mixing patterns have been well-documented, there has been limited speculation on the contributions of particulate organic carbon pools within the sediments that arise from transient hydrologic conditions. To understand the relationship between physical movements of the circulation cell and the seasonal migration of geochemical patterns, beach porewater and sediment samples from six field sampling events spanning two years were analyzed. While oxygen saturation, oxygen consumption rates, and silica distributions closely followed the seasonally-dynamic salinity, other chemically-reactive parameters (pH, ORP) and nutrient characteristics (N distributions, denitrification rates, reactive organic carbon distributions) were unrelated to contemporaneous salinity patterns. Particulate organic matter was distributed in pools within the aquifer due to the filtration effect of sediments, contributing to the divergence of chemical patterns from salinity patterns via nutrient release and leaching. Together, the results present the asynchronous movement of chemical conditions to salinity patterns due to the divergent transport pathways between solutes and particles arising from transient hydrologic forcing."

They are the source of floods, which are among the Nation's most severe natural disasters, both in loss of life and in economic damage. They provide the habitat, spawning grounds, and avenues of movement for fish. Streams are a source of great recreational activity in terms of boating, fishing, and simple enjoyment of visiting and viewing the stream and its environs. Finally, streams are indicators of the condition of the landscape. They integrate effects from their entire watershed. 



Surface-water information collected at these streamflow-measurement stations is used for surveillance, planning, design, flood warning, operation and management of dams, in water-related fields such as water supply, flood control, irrigation, bridge and culvert design, wildlife management, pollution abatement, flood-plain management, and water-resources development.

CompositeResource,"CRBCZO -- Stream Water Chemistry, Stream Ecology -- USGS -- Chester County, PA -- (1998-2013)",0a21b00a54d641e5aa5da0bc32998ad1,"Since 1969, the U.S. Geological Survey and the Chester County Water Resources Authority have conducted a cooperative program to evaluate stream ecology and water-quality conditions using benthic macroinvertebrates and stream-water chemistry. The Stream Conditions of Chester County Program has sampled streams every fall for over 30 years. The initial goals of the program were to evaluate stream-water quality and to further the understanding of changes in the stream ecosystem in response to urbanization. The current goals of the program are to use the data to monitor current conditions and determine trends. Data from the program have been used to help support Chester County Landscapes by providing information on biological diversity and water-quality conditions. Without monitoring it is impossible to determine if changes in land use or environmental policies and regulation are having a positive affect on water quality.



Benthic macroinvertebrates are macroscopic animals that inhabit the bottoms of aquatic habitats. Freshwater forms include aquatic insects and other invertebrates including clams, crustaceans, snails, and worms. Factors such as streamflow, food availability, habitat, temperature, and water quality determine the makeup of the macroinvertebrate community. By sampling in similar habitats with similar physical conditions, water quality becomes the determining factor controlling community structure. Changes in abundance, diversity, species richness, and presence or absence of pollution tolerant or intolerant species can be measured and related to water quality. Trends in water quality can be determined by sampling at a single location over several years and observing changes to the community structure. 



Benthic macroinvertebrates are well suited as water-quality indicators because of their biology and availability. They are present in most aquatic systems and are relatively easy to collect. They are indicators of overall water quality and can be used to identify specific types and sources of degraded water quality. Benthic macroinvertebrates have limited mobility and cannot avoid poor water-quality conditions. They are sensitive to a wide range of environmental impacts including chemical and physical impairments. 



Biological samples collected for the Stream Conditions of Chester County Biological Monitoring Network consist of benthic macroinvertebrates collected from a riffle area of the stream. A riffle habitat is used because macroinvertebrate diversity and abundance is usually highest there.

This is project presents data related to discharge measurements from the Bisley Watershed in the Luquillo Mountains.
Long-term rainfall and discharge data from the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) were analyzed to develop relationships between rainfall, stream-runoff, and elevation. These relationships were then used with a Geographic Information System (GIS) to determine spatially-averaged, mean annual hydrologic budgets for watersheds and forest types within the study area. Model estimates indicate that a total of 3864 mm/yy (444 hm3) of rainfall falls on the forest in an average year. The Tabonuco, Colorado, Palm and Dwarf Forest types receive an estimated annual rainfall of 3537, 4191, 4167, and 4849 mm/yy, respectively. Of the average annual rainfall input, 65% (2526 mm/yr) is converted to runoff and the remainding 35% (1338 mm.yr) is lost from the system by evapotranspiration and other abstractions. In comparison to other tropical forests, the LEF as a whole has more evapotranspiration than many tropical montane forests but less evapotranspiration than many lowland tropical forests.
